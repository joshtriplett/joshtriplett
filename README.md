I'm a developer on the Rust project. I co-lead the Rust language team, and work on the Cargo package manager. I care about building welcoming, inclusive communities that lift people up. I love building solutions to systemic problems.

I've been thinking about build systems and how to improve them for more than 16 years. In July 2020, I left my job to start working on making it easier and faster to compile software, in Rust and other languages. This includes constructing software from many different modules and components, in different languages, and compiling it 12-120x faster than the typical developer laptop. My goal is to make waiting on a build as antiquated as the sound of a dial-up modem.

I'm seeking [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/joshtriplett/) to continue working on Rust and build systems full-time.
