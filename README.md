In July 2020, I left my job to start working on the build service I've wanted for 16 years, in Rust: no change to your workflow, cooperates with existing build systems, handles multi-stage builds, works with any language, and the first version will support offloading builds to fast cloud systems to compile 12-120x faster than a developer laptop.

My goal is to make waiting on a build as antiquated as the sound of a dial-up modem. I expect to launch an alpha in 2020 and a beta early 2021; please email or DM me if you're interested in trying them out.

I'm a developer on the Rust project. I co-lead the Rust language team, and work on the Cargo package manager. I care about building welcoming, inclusive communities that lift people up. I love building solutions to systemic problems.

I'm seeking [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/joshtriplett/) to continue working on Rust and build systems full-time.
